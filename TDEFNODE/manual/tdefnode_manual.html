<p><h2><b>BACKGROUND</h2></b>

<p><b>TDEFNODE</b> is a Fortran program to model elastic lithospheric block rotations and internal strains, locking on block-bounding faults, 
and transient sources such as earthquakes, afterslip, slow-slip, volcanic sources, etc.  Block motions are specified by spherical 
Earth angular velocities (Euler rotation poles) and interseismic backslip is applied along faults that separate blocks, 
based on the routines of Okada (1985; 1992). The faults are specified by lon-lat-depth coordinates of nodes (forming an irregular 
grid of points) along the fault planes. The parameters are estimated by simulated annealing or grid search.

<p>This version differs from DEFNODE largely in that time dependent deformation and data can be considered. GPS time series 
and multiple InSAR interferograms can be modeled using the steady block model, as in DEFNODE, with the addition of time-dependent 
sources. This version also allows the blocks to be built from the fault segments (+mkb flag).

<p><b>DISCLAIMER</b> I make no guarantees whatsoever that this program will do what you want it to do or what you think it is doing. 
It has more than 30,000 lines of code and I guarantee some bugs are there. I have not tested every option thoroughly and have 
not documented every option. However, I use it extensively for my own research as is. I am happy to hear about tests you 
perform and will try to fix any bugs you discover.

<p><b>REQUEST</b> Please do not make changes to the code and/or re-disribute it. 
I am happy to help with any improvements or changes.

A plotting package called <i>td_plot</i> is provided. <a href= tdefnode_gmt.html>Plot with GMT</a>

<p><b>Prior users:</b>
The program is greatly modified from earlier versions. Many commands are the same, but many are also changed, 
and there are many new ones. It is advised to browse the commands to see the changes. 

<p><b>INSTALLATION:</b> Before compiling, do the following:

<p> See <a href = README> README</a>


<p><b>ABBREVIATIONS used:</b>
<ul>
<li>GF - Green's functions
<li>SV - earthquake slip vector azimuth
<li>GPS - Global Positioning System
<li>SRT - strain rate tensor
<li><i>phi</i> - fault locking ratio
</ul>

<p><b>NOTES:</b>

<p><b>Directories:</b> All output will be put into a directory specified by the MO: (model) command. The program also produces a directory called 'gfs' (or a 3-character, user-assigned directory name) to store the Green's function files. 

<p><b>Poles (angular velocities) and blocks:</b> You can specify many poles and many blocks (dimensioned with MAX_poles, MAX_blocks). There is NOT a one-one correspondence between poles and blocks. More than one block can be assigned the same pole (ie, the blocks rotate together) but each block can be assigned only one pole. Poles can be specified as (lat,lon,omega) or by their Cartesian components (<i>W<sub>x</sub>, W<sub>y</sub>, W<sub>z</sub></i>). Poles can be fixed or adjusted. Angular velocities are relative to the center of the Earth and obey the right-hand rule. Looking from above (in map view), negative rotations will be clockwise.

<p><b>Strain rates and blocks:</b> The uniform, horizontal strain rate tensors (SRT) for the blocks are input in a similar way as the rotation poles. Each SRT is assigned an index (integer) and blocks are assigned a SRT index. As with poles, more than one block can be assigned to a single SRT. Velocities are estimated from the SRT using the block's centroid as origin (default) or a user-assigned origin (see ST:); if multiple blocks use the same SRT assign an origin for this SRT (with ST: option). SRTs can be fixed or adjusted.

<p><b>Faults and blocks:</b> Faults along which backslip is applied are specified and must coincide point-for-point at the surface with block boundary polygons. However, not all sections of block boundaries have to be specified as a fault. If the boundary is not specified as a fault it is treated as free-slipping and will not produce any elastic strain (ie, there will be a step in velocity across the boundary). By specifying no faults, you can solve for the block rotations alone.

<p><i>Making blocks from faults: </i> The program can now make the blocks from the faults alone using the algorithm of W. R. Franklin. This is done with the +mkb flag. However, the faults input, when connected, must together form a series of closed polygons. In other words, every point (surface node) must be on at least 2 fault segments. If they don't, an error 'Fix unmatched segment' is produced and the program stops. The unmatched segments are written to the screen and you must fix them. To close blocks, 'pseudo-faults' can be used - they are 'faults' with nodes only at the surface and are treated as free-slip boundaries (see FA:). With this option, you do not need to input blocks (BL:) separately but do need to assign block names with the BC: option.

<p><b>Fault nodes:</b> Fault surfaces are specified in 3 dimensions by nodes whose positions are given by their longitude and latitude (in degrees) and depth (in km, positive down). Nodes are placed along depth contours of the faults and each depth contour must have the same number of nodes. Nodes thus form an irregular grid on the fault surface. Nodes are numbered in order first along strike, then down dip. The figure below shows the numbering system for the nodes. Strike is the direction faced if the fault dips off to your right. Faults cannot be exactly vertical (90<sup>o</sup> dip) as the hangingwall and footwall blocks must be defined. The fault geometry at depth can be built either by specifying all the node coordinates individually or automatically using the DD: and ZD: options.

<p><center><img src=td_fig1.gif width = 400 ><br>Fig. 1 Indexing of nodes on the fault surface.</center>

<p>The coupling fractions (ratio of locked to total slip, called <i>phi</i>) or slip amplitude (for coseismic applications) are either specified or estimated at the nodes. The 'slip deficit rate vector' is <i>phi</i> is multiplied by the slip vector <i>V</i> at the node, where <i>V</i> is estimated from the angular velocities. The <i>slip rate deficit</i> gives rise to the elastic deformation around the fault. For coseismic, <i>phi</i> is the fault slip amplitude and the unit vector <i>V</i> gives the slip direction.

<p>The elastic deformation is calculated by integrating over small patches (quadrilaterals) in the regions between the nodes (see figure above). The Okada method is used to calculate surface velocities while applying backslip at a rate of -<i>V Phi</i> (or <i>V Phi</i> for coseismic) on each of these little patches. Because the Okada formulas used are for rectangular patches, the sizes of the interpolated patches should be kept small (less than a few kilometers). As the patches get smaller their deviations from rectangles matters less (the point source approximation).

<p><center><img src=td_fig2.jpg width = 300 ><br>Fig. 2 Definition of Okada rectangular fault plane. U1 is strike-slip, U2 is dip-slip and U3 is tensional (normal to fault plane)</center>
<p><center><img src=td_fig3.jpg width = 600 ><br>Fig. 3 Aki and Richards convention for fault planes (from Toda et al., 2011; USGS OFR 2011-1060). </center>

<p>The distribution of interseismic locking or co-seismic slip on the fault can be parameterized in several ways (see FT: option for details). The nodes can be treated as independent parameters or can be grouped such that multiple nodes have the same <i>phi</i> value. The distribution of slip can also be set to one of a few specified functions of depth (exponential, boxcar, or Gaussian) along depth profiles, called z-profiles. In this case, the parameters for the function can be varied along strike on the z-profiles. This version allows 2D Gaussian distributions of slip on the fault surface that may be suitable for earthquakes or slow slip events.

<p><b>Transients:</b> are represented by combining a spatial slip distribution with a temporal slip distribution. Use the ES:, EI:, EX: and EF: commands and optionally ER: and ET:. Some other commands are applied to transients by putting a 't' in the third column. For example SMt: applies smoothing to transient slip distributions.

<p><b>Green's functions:</b> If you are performing an inversion, the program uses unit response (Green's) functions (GFs) for the elastic deformation part of the problem since the inversion method (downhill simplex) has to calculate numerous forward models. The GFs are put in a directory called 'gfs' (or a user-specified directory using GD: option) and the files are named with the form gf001001001g, gf001002001g, etc. First 3 digits are fault number, next 3 are the along strike (X) node index, the next 3 are the downdip (Z) node index, the final letter is the data type; g - GPS, i - InSAR, t - Tilts, s - strain rates. Once you have calculated GFs for a particular set of faults you can use these in inversions without recalculating them (see option GD: ). The GFs are based on the node geometry, GPS data, InSAR data, strain tensor data, and tilt rate data so if you change the node positions or ADD data, you need to re-calculate GFs. If you REMOVE data, you do not need to recalculate GFs. You can add or subtract slip azimuths, slip rate, and rotation rate data without re-calculating GFs since those data are calculated from the rotation poles only. If you change a node position the program will detect the change it and re-calculate only the necessary GFs.

<p>If you add GPS vectors, the program will detect that their GFs may be missing but will not automatically calculate them. In this case, re-calculate all the GFs.

<p>The GFs are the responses at the surface observation points to a unit velocity (or displacement) in the North and East directions at the central node. The slip velocity is tapered to zero at all adjacent nodes.

<p><b>Data files and weighting:</b> Data files are generally in free-format but the information must be in the correct order as outlined below. Multiple data files can be specified and they are all read in and used. An uncertainty scaling factor <i>F</i> can be applied to each data file; this number is multiplied by the data standard errors given in the file. Since the weight applied is the inverse of the datum variance, the weight of the datum will be multiplied by 
<i>F</i><sup>-2</sup>. If <i>s</i> is the standard deviation of the datum given in the file, the new standard deviation <i>s'</i> = <i>sF</i> and the weight =<i>s' </i><sup>-2</sup> = (<i>sF</i>)<sup>-2</sup>. Data covariance is used when the correlation coefficient is given for GPS vectors.

<p>Some data types can be entered within the control file itself.


<p><b>Inversion:</b> The inversion finds the set of parameters that minimizes the sum of the reduced chi-squared statistic <i>X<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup></i>  plus any penalties: 
<p>
<i>X<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup></i> = [ SUM r<sup>2</sup>/(sF)<sup>2</sup>] /<i>dof</i> 
<p>
where r is the residual, s is the standard deviation, F is the scaling factor just described, and <i>dof</i> is the degrees of freedom (number of observations minus number of free parameters). The SUM is over all data. For angular data, the r/s is determined using the equation of DeMets et al. (1990).

<p>Penalties are used to keep parameters within specified bounds and to apply smoothing of slip distributions.

<p>Minimization of <i>X<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup></i> + Penalties is performed by the simulated annealing technique (see Press et al. 1989), grid search or linear inverse. These are controlled by the SA: (simulated annealing), GS: (grid search), and IC: (iteration control) commands.  

<p><b>Units:</b> 
<ul>
<li>Slip rates, GPS velocities -- millimeters per year (positive east, north, and up)
<li>GPS displacements -- millimeters  (positive east, north, and up)
<li>InSAR LOS displacements -- millimeters  (positive increasing LOS distance)
<li>Depths -- kilometers (positive down)
<li>Elevations -- kilometers (positive up)
<li>Latitude, longitude - degrees
<li>Azimuths -- degrees relative to North
<li>Strain rates -- nanostrain/year (10<sup>-9</sup> per year; negative is contraction)
<li>Rotation rates -- degrees per million years (positive for anticlockwise in map view)
<li>Time -- decimal years
</ul>

<p><b>Coordinates:</b> 
<ul>
<li>All coordinates (except poles) are entered in geographic lon, lat order.  
<li>Poles are lat, lon, omega following common use - Cartesian components can also be used. 
<li>North latitude is positive, South is negative. 
<li>Longitude can be entered in either 0 to 360, or -180 to +180 degrees. 
The program converts all longitudes to 0 to 360 unless the -pos flag is set in which case the -180 to +180 range is used. 
</ul>

<p><b>Miscellaneous notes and suggestions:</b>
<ul>
<li>Each fault must have a unique footwall block. It can have a changing hangingwall block (along strike or down-dip) which the program determines 
    (the hanging wall block you specify does not have to be correct, but the footwall block must be correct and unique for the fault).
<li>Fault locking: fault locking defaults to uniform locking but the FF: flag is initiall turned OFF. Locking is controlled with NN: (or PN:) and FF: options
<li>Fault dip angle cannot be 90<sup>o</sup> or greater or less than zero. (Hangingwall and footwall blocks must be unambiguous.)
<li>Either a profile, grid, or input data are required to tell the program where to calculate surface velocities.
<li>Exceeding array dimensions is not always checked explicitly and can cause strange behavior.
<li>It is sometimes advisable to put character strings in quotes (filenames, for example) if the program has trouble reading the file.
<li>The program also sometimes has trouble reading tabs, avoid tabs in data files.
<li>The program tries to catch simple mistakes and produces warnings, output to the screen.
<li>To stop iterating, press the 'q' key or create a file called 'stop', 'MODLstop' or 'stopMODL' in the working directory 
    (where MODL is the model name given by the MO: option).
<li>If you are working near the prime meridian and have both positive and negative longitudes, use the -pos flag.
</ul>

<p><b>ITERATING: </b> The IC: option controls the iterations; 1 for simulated annealing, 2 for grid search, 3 for linear inversion. 
While iterating, press 'q' to stop or 's' to go to the next step in the IC: list. During grid search press 'n' to jump to the next step of the grid search.
Linear inversions can be used only for the simplest, linear problems like solving for poles and strains without fault locking.

<p><b><h2>CONTROL FILE</b></h2>

<p>The program reads the model and all controls from an ASCII file. Some data can be in the control file. 
The control file format is described here. 

<p>Lines in the control file comprise a keyword section and a data section. The keyword section starts with a 2-character 
keyword (they have to be in the first 2 columns) and ends with a colon (:). Normally only the first 2 characters of the keyword are used 
so in general any characters between the 3rd
character and the : are ignored. The third character is sometimes used to specify a format or a transient input as outlined below.  
<b><br>THE KEYWORD MUST START IN THE FIRST COLUMN OR THE LINE IS IGNORED.</b> 
<br>Case does not matter. Comments may be added after a second colon in the line.

<p>The data section of the input line goes from the colon to the end of the line (or to a second colon) and its contents 
depend on the keyword. In a few cases the data section comprises multiple lines (always BL:, FA:, and PV:, and sometimes NN: and NV:).

<p>For example, the key characters for a fault are 'FA' and this has two arguments, the fault name and the fault number, 
so the following lines are correct:
<pre>
fa: JavaTrench 1
fault: JT 1
fault (Java trench): JavaTr 1 
FA: JT 1  : this is the Java Trench
</pre>
but 

<pre>
thrust fault: 1
 fault: JT 1
fault 1 : JavaTrench
</pre>
are not valid.
<p>Some notes on input lines:
<ul> 
<li>Lines without valid key characters in the first 2 columns are ignored, unless they are part of a multiline data section. 
<li>Input lines can be commented out by putting any other character in the first column ( ' or # or a space, for examples). 
<li>Multiline data sections can be skipped by commenting out the keyword line only. 
<li>Contiguous lines of input can be skipped by bracketing them within the SK: (skip) and CO: (continue) keyword options.
<li>It is advisable and good practice to start comment lines with a space, *, # or some other character outside the 
range A - Z (the program has many undocumented options and you may trigger one by accident).
<li>The PO: command to enter Euler poles uses lat, lon order instead of the lon, lat order used everywhere else in the program.
</ul>

<p>Multiple instances can exist in the control file for somew types of input; the program uses the last valid occurrence it finds. 
For example, if the following pole specification lines are in the control file
<pre>
pole: 1 -20 40 .2
pole: 1 -19 33 .1
</pre>
the values (-19, 33, .1) will be assigned to pole 1, over-writing the earlier instance.

<p>An exception to this rule pertains to data files, that are all used.

<p>The order of the statements in the control file should not matter since the program reads it multiple times. 
The control file can contain lines after the end of input (EN:) statement and these are ignored.
<p>The control file can contain multiple models through the use of the MO: - EM: structure.

<i>Migration</i>: The source can migrate spatially across the Earth's surface or across the fault (via +ndl flag). 
The delays are based on an elliptical front due to 
different along strike and down-dip migration rates. The source starts at a time To (to; Parameter 27) at a Longitude (ln; Parm 21) and Latitude (lt; Parm 22). 
The source migrates along strike (xr; Parm 29) and down-dip (wr; Parm 30). If +ndl flag is set the migration is along the surface of the fault; 
if -ndl flag is set the source migrates relative to the surface (an apparent migration rate as recorded by the sites). The former is more exact but runs slower.

<p><i>Fault slip mode</i> - if set to 0, only shear is used on the fault (ie, the total horizontal convergence velocity is rotated into the fault plane, 
Okada's U1 and U2), 
if set to 1, the U3 (tensional) component is used also. 
If this is changed, the Green's functions must be re-calculated.
<pre>
If set to zero (0):
       U1 =  Ux*sin(Strike) + Uy*cos(Strike)
       U2 = -Ux*cos(Strike) + Uy*sin(Strike)
       U3 =  0.0

If set to one (1):
       U1 =     Ux*sin(Strike) + Uy*cos(Strike)
       U2 =   [-Ux*cos(Strike) + Uy*sin(Strike)] * cos(Dip)  
       U3 =   [ Ux*cos(Strike) - Uy*sin(Strike)] * sin(Dip) 
</pre>
where Ux and Uy are the East and North components of the relative motion at the fault node.
<p><i>Automated node generation at depth</i> (<b>DD:</b> and <b>ZD:</b>).
<br>Subsurface nodes defining a fault surface can also be set up automatically by the program. In this case you specify the surface nodes and then the depth and dip angle to the nodes at depth using <b>DD:</b> or <b>ZD:</b>. For example:

<pre>
fa:  SAF 2
 3 2 NOAM PACI 0  
0.0
 125.  35.
 125.  36.
 125.  40.
dd: 6. 85.
dd: 8. 87.
</pre>

<p>The <b>DD:</b> option is followed by the incremental depth and dip angle to the next set of nodes down-dip. The <b>ZD:</b> option is the same except the depth given is the actual depth (not an incremental depth). The dip azimuth is taken as the normal to the fault strike as defined by the adjacent nodes.
In the example above, the 2nd set of nodes will be 6 km deeper than the surface nodes and at a dip angle of 85<sup>o</sup> from them. The 3rd set of nodes will be 8 km deeper (at 14 km depth) than the second set and at a dip angle of 87<sup>o</sup> from them. An equivalent setup, using ZD: would be:
<pre>
fa:  SAF 2
 3 3 NOAM PACI 0

 125  36
 125  40
zd:  6. 85.
zd: 14. 87.
</pre>

<i>Adding a new node along strike</i>. 
To add a new node along strike, put a 2 in the third column of the Lon Lat line. This adds a new surface node halfway 
between this node and the next and generates all nodes downdip of the new one. For example:

<pre>
fa:  SAF 2
 3 2 NOAM PACI 0  
0.0
 125  35 0
 125  36 2
 125  40 0
zd:  6. 85.

</pre>

results in surface nodes at:

<pre>
 125  35 
 125  36  
 125  38
 125  40  
</pre>

and a new node downdip of the new surface node at 125 38. Do not change the number of nodes along strike in the FA: option but keep in mind that there are more nodes, for other relevant options.

<p><i>Changing fault dip azimuth</i>. In the cases above, tdefnode determines the dip azimuth from the surface nodes to those at depth by taking the normal to the fault azimuth (i.e., dip azimuth = fault azimuth + 90<sup>o</sup>). The dip azimuth can be specified explicitly by entering a 1 as the third entry on the Lon, Lat line of the surface nodes followed by the desired dip azimuth. The example above would default to a dip azimuth of 90<sup>o</sup> since the fault strikes North. To change this to 95<sup>o</sup>, do:

<pre>
fa:  SAF 2
 3 3 NOAM PACI 0  
0.0
 125.  35. 1 95.
 125.  36. 1 95.
 125.  40. 1 95.
zd:  6. 85.
zd: 14. 87.
</pre>


<i>Changing fault dip along strike</i>. Sometimes the dip angle of a fault may change along strike. This can also be accommodated automatically with the <b>DD:</b> or <b>ZD:</b> lines. In the <b>DD:</b> or <b>ZD:</b> line you specify first the depth increment (or depth for ZD:), then the dip angle, then (optionally) the number of nodes along strike that have this dip angle, then a new dip angle followed by the number of nodes with that dip angle, and so on. For example,

<pre>
fa:  SAF 2
 5  3 NOAM PACI 0  
0.0
 125.  35. 1 95.
 125.  36. 1 90.
 125.  37. 1 90.
 125.  38. 1 90.
 125.  40. 1 95.
zd:  6. 85. 2  88. 3
zd: 14. 87. 2  89. 3
</pre>
In this case, downdip from the first 2 surface nodes, the fault will dip at 85<sup>o</sup> to 6 km depth and at 87<sup>o</sup> to 14km depth. Downdip from the last 3 nodes, the fault will dip at 88<sup>o</sup> to 6 km depth and at 89<sup>o</sup> to 14km depth. The general format is:

<pre>zd: Z Dip1 N1 Dip2 N2 Dip3 N3 ... </pre>

where Z is the depth (km), Dip1 is the dip angle from the depth above to Z, N1 is the number of nodes along strike with this dip, N2 is the number of nodes along strike with dip angle of Dip2, and so on. The dip angles specified are always for the depth increment above the depth of Z. Make sure the sum of the N's equals the number of nodes in the along strike direction.

<p><i>Automated contour generation at a new depth</i> (<b>ND:</b> ).
Using <b>ND:</b> allows you to add a contour of fault nodes automatically. It does a linear interpolation of the nodes above and below to find the new node position. It can only be used for faults where the node positions are specified (i.e., not using ZD: or DD:) and the node positions are specified above and below the new depth. The ND: keyword is followed by the depth of the new contour.
<pre>nd: Depth in km </pre>
Example:
<pre>
fa:  SAF 2
 5  3 NOAM PACI 0  
0.0
 125.  35.

 125.1  37.  
 125.1  38.  
 125.1  40.  
</pre>
In this example, the node positions at 0.0 and 10.0 km depths are specified and a new contour of nodes will be inserted at 5.0 km automatically 

<p><i>Pseudo faults</i>. Pseudo-faults are used to close block polygons when making blocks from faults (+mkb flag). They have only surface nodes (number of depths = 1). Such boundaries have free-slip. For example:

<hr><b>FT - interseismic fault node parameterization type </b>
<pre>ft: Fault#  Type  F1 F2 F3 S </pre>

Parameterization of interseismic locking distributions on faults can be done in a number of ways. These fall into 2 classes: independent node values and node-depth-profiles with a down-dip functional distribution. In the independent node methods (Types 0 and 1), the node values can be independent in both strike and depth. In the node-depth-profile mode (Types 2, 3 and 4), slip at the nodes are prescribed functions of depth. Along strike and down-dip smooting can be applied to all types.

<br>The flags F1 F2 F3 control whether the 3 parameters describing the node-depth-profiles (Types 2 - 4) are fixed(0) or free(1).
<br>S is the optional skewness factor for the Gaussian 1D option.
<br>NX: is used to fix any of the node-depth-profiles.

<p>Types of parameterization for the fault nodes:
<pre>
Type = 0 independent nodes (each node can be a free parameter or nodes can be grouped)

     = 1 independent nodes, phi decreasing down-dip (equivalent to type = 0, flag=+ddc) 
         (each node can be a free parameter)
          constraint is phi(z+1) <= phi(z)

     = 2 modified Wang et al. (2003) function for phi(z); free parameters G, Z1, Z2 (Z2 > Z1)
          G' = G        ( 0.0 <= G <= 10.0 )
          G' = 20.0 - G (10.0 <  G <= 20.0 )
          phi(z) = 1.0  (z <= Z1)

<ul>
<li>'Directory' is for Green's functions files. Default is 'gfs'. Directory name must be 3 characters, no spaces.
<li>X_step, W_step are sizes of patches along fault surfaces for integration between nodes (for GFs only). 
X_step - length of fault patch (in km) along strike (default 10 km); W_step - length of fault patch (in km) downdip (default 5 km). The X, W interpolation values specified here can be different from those in the IN: option.
<li> Flag > 0; re-calculate all Green's functions
<li> dx_node = tolerance (in km) of new node position that triggers calculation of new Green's functions (default 1 km)
<li> x_near = proximity (in km) of sites that use same Green's functions (default 1 km)
<li> x_far = don't generate GFs for sites farther than x_far (in km) from any node (default 1500 km)
</ul>
<pre>gd: gf1 2 1 0 1 1 1000.</pre>
will place GFs in directory 'gf1'. Step size for GF integration is 2 km along strike, 1 km downdip.

<p>Before generating a new GF, the program checks whether or not the current GF is up to date by looking at the node position, surrounding node positions, the interpolation distances (if the new ones are greater than or equal to the stored ones, new GF is not generated). If the stored GF does not match, a new one is generated. Sometimes, this checking can fail, for example if you add new data. To override the checking and regenerate all GFs, set Flag = 1 (or manually delete all the GF files).

<pre>
gd: ggg 5 2 1
</pre>

will force generation of all new GFs. 

<p>The GFs are in ASCII files named gf001001001g, gf001002001g, etc. in the directory specified by the GD: option. (File names; first 3 digits are fault number, second 3 are the along strike node index, the third 3 are the downdip node index, and the final letter designates the data type; g - GPS, u - Uplift, t - Tilts, s - strain rates) 
<p>Important note: If you add new data you must re-generate all GFs. The program cannot append new GFs to the existing GF files.

<pre>MO: MOD1 MOD2 MOD3 ... </pre>
The model name (exactly 4 characters) is selected when running program and used as the prefix to name output files and directory.
A directory with this name will be created and all output files placed in it.
<p>The MO: option can have multiple names as arguments.
<p>To specify unique parameters for several models in a single input file, 
make a model input section as follows:
<pre>

##  start model input section
mo: mod1
pi: 1 2 4
gi: 1
pf:  "mod1/io1.pio"  3

mo: mod2 mod3
pi: 2 3
gi: 2
pf:  "mod2/io2.pio"  3

mo: mod3  
rm: INDO BABI
pi: 3
pf:  "mod3/io3.pio"  3

em:
## end model input section
</pre>

<p>The first MO: command marks the beginning of the models input section, and the EM: command marks its end.
<p>When you run tdefnode, specify the model to use as the second command-line argument, for example:
<pre>% tdefnode models.inp mod2</pre>

<p>If you do not specify a model at runtime, tdefnode will use the last model it finds in the file. 
In the case above it will run model mod3 but will use some of the 
specifications of the prior models, such as the GI: line which is not given for mod3.
<p>For a specified model, tdefnode will process and use all input lines leading up to the first MO: line, all lines 
within the specified model, and all lines after the EM: line up to the EN: line.
<p>Multiple models in one line: In the example above, choosing 'mod3' will reult in tdefnode using the commands listed under 
both MO: lines that contain mod3. The commands will be processed in order, with the later ones overwriting earlier. 
For example, in the example if mod3 is selected, then 'pi: 3' will be used instead of 'pi: 2 3'.

<hr><b>NN[git] (NF) - node indices</b>
<pre>NN: F I I I I I I I </pre>
Node indices 
<p>
F = fault number
<br>I = parameter index, one for each node on fault, in order (see introductory notes for ordering of nodes).

<p>Each node on the fault is assigned an index number which is used to assign properties to it (its phi, inversion characteristics). 

<p>If the index is not zero or in the 
fixed node list, the node is a free parameter in the inversion. 

<p>The initial slip ratio (phi) for 
this node is taken from the list of node phi values (the NV: input line). 
For example, if the node has index 5 assigned, it is assigned the phi that is fifth in the NV: list for this fault. 

<p>In the example below, the first 3 nodes of fault 1 have slip ratio (phi) values of 0.1, 
the next 3 have phi values of 0.2, the next 3 nodes have phi = 0.3, and the last 3 are zero. 
The nx: line fixes the last 3 nodes at phi=0 in the inversion.
<pre>
nn: 1  1 1 1  2 2 2  3 3 3  4 4 4
nv: 1  .1  .2  .3 0.
nx: 1  4 
</pre>

<p>For multiple faults, the index numbering starts with 1 for each fault:
<pre>
nn: 1  1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3  4 4 4
nv: 1  .1 .2 .3 0.
nx: 1  4 

nn: 2  1 1 2 2 3 3
nv: 2  .3 .6 .9
</pre>
<p>Using 999 for the fault number applies to all faults.
<pre>
nn: 999 1
</pre>
<p>will set the indices for all nodes, all faults to 1, or you can use
<pre>
nn: 999 0
</pre>
<p>to set the indices for all nodes, all faults to 0, which turns all faults off (free-slip on all faults.)


<p>An alternative, more intuitive input format is available by using NNg: In this case the node indices are entered in a grid, mimicking their spatial relation on the fault.

<pre>
NNg: 3 4 5
 1 1 2 2
 3 3 4 4
 5 5 5 5
 5 5 5 5
 0 0 0 0
</pre>
The first argument after the NNg: is the fault number, then the number of nodes along strike, then number of nodes downdip. The node indices are then listed in a grid fashion.
<p>The example above is equivalent to the single line NN: form:
<pre>nn: 3  1 1 2 2  3 3 4 4  5 5 5 5  5 5 5 5  0 0 0 0</pre>

<p>To build the indices by specifying ranges of nodes, use NNi: as follows.
<pre>
NNi: F  Nx  Nz  Nx1 Nx2 Nxstep Nz1 Nz2 Nzstep Amp

F is fault number
Nx - number of nodes along strike
Nz - Number of nodes downdip
Set non-zero parameter indices for along-strike nodes from Nx1 to Nx2 and downdip nodes from Nz1 to Nz2
Nxstep and Nzstep are the number of adjacent nodes to give the same parameter index 
Amp is the starting amplitude for the nodes with non-zero parameter indices

For example, Fault 1 has 10 nodes along strike and 9 downdip:

NNi: 1  10 9   4 7 2   3 7 1   1.0

would produce the node indices (like NNg) :

 0 0 0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0
 0 0 0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0
 0 0 0  1  1  2  2 0 0 0
 0 0 0  3  3  4  4 0 0 0
 0 0 0  5  5  6  6 0 0 0
 0 0 0  7  7  8  8 0 0 0
 0 0 0  9  9 10 10 0 0 0
 0 0 0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0
 0 0 0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0
</pre>


<p>For transients use NNt: similar to NNi:, as follows.
<pre>
NNt: T  Nx  Nz  Nx1 Nx2 Nxstep Nz1 Nz2 Nzstep Amp

T is transient number
Nx - number of nodes along strike
Nz - Number of nodes downdip
Set non-zero parameter indices for along-strike nodes from Nx1 to Nx2 and downdip nodes from Nz1 to Nz2
Nxstep and Nzstep are the number of adjacent nodes to give the same parameter index 
Amp is the starting amplitude for the nodes with non-zero parameter indices

For example, Transient 1 is on a fault with 10 nodes along strike and 9 downdip:

NNt: 1 10  9   4 7 2  3 7 1  1.0

would produce the node indices (like NNg) :

 0 0 0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0
 0 0 0  0  0  0  0 0 0 0
 0 0 0  1  1  2  2 0 0 0
 0 0 0  3  3  4  4 0 0 0

<pre>
PN:  F  I I I I I

</pre>
F = fault number or S = transient number
<br>I = node-depth-profile indices

<p>The nodes on faults can be parameterized as specified functions of depth, for interseismic slip or transients.
In this mode, each node-depth-profile starts at the surface node and goes downdip along the fault
(each node in the node-depth-profile therefore has the same x-index). 
A fault has the number of node-depth-profiles equal to its number of surface points. 
The phi (or slip) values in a node-depth-profile follow a specified function of depth (see FT: option).
<p>The node-depth-profile parameters are controlled by the PN:, PV:, and PX: options
much like the NN:, NV:, and NX: options control the individual node parameters. PNt: and PVt: are used for transients.
<pre>
PN: 1  1 1 2 2 3 4 4
</pre>
<p>In this example, fault 1 has 7 node-depth-profiles along strike. The first 2 will have the same parameters, the 3rd and 4th will have equal parameters, and so on.
<p>Example below is a Gaussian function of depth for fault 1. The first 3 of the 6 node-depth-profiles have shared parameters
and second set of 3 have shared parameters. The PV: option gives the initial parameter values for the indices. 
Node-depth-profiles 1 to 3 are assigned index 1 in the PN: statement and node-depth-profiles 4-6 have index 2. 
Index 1 has parameters of 0.5, 20 and 3 so these are assigned to node-depth-profiles 1 to 3. 
Index 2 has parameters of 0.8, 25 and 5 so these are assigned to node-depth-profiles 4 to 6.
In the inversion node-depth-profiles 1 to 3 will always have the same parameters since they are assigned the same index.
Simialrly 4 to 6 will share the same parameter values. The last 3 numbers in the FT: line indicate that all 3 parameters are
to be adjusted by the inversion.
<pre>
# Fault 1 is set to a Gaussian function of depth (type 4) and 
#   all 3 parameters are to be adjusted

# Fault 1 has 6 nodes in the strike-direction; the first 3 will

PN: 1  1 1 1  2 2 2
# Set the initial parameter values for the Gaussian function. On the PV: line are listed
#   the fault number and then the number of unique indices (from PN: line, in this case 2).
#   The first row after the PV: line gives the values of the first parameter (Amplitude) for indices 1 and 2.
#   The second row after the PV: line gives the values of the second parameter (Mean depth) for indices 1 and 2.
#   The third row after the PV: line gives the values of the third parameter (Depth spread) for indices 1 and 2.

</pre>
<p>For transients the type of slip distribution is specified in the ES: line. 
For example, in using a 1D down-dip Gaussian distribution for the transient, 
the ES: line would contain 'sp 4' and initial values set in teh ES: line 
using ga, gm and gs. The PNt: line specifies 
the node-depth-profile indices. 
PVt: could be used to specify initial values of ga, gm and gs.

<hr><b>SR[df] - fault slip rate data</b>

<p>Fault slip rate data are the horizontal velocities between a pair of adjacent blocks. The blocks must be specified.
Three input options are available:

<p><li>Read as line directly from control file:
<pre>srd: FIXD MVNG Long Lat V1 V2 Azimuth Smin Type Label</pre>
</ul>

where
<ul>
<li>filename = slip rate (or spreading rate) data file
<li>Slip rates V1 and V2 (in mm/yr) are between Block FIXD (Fixed) and block MVNG (Moving).
<li>F = scaling factor (F multiplied by all sigmas)
<li>Azimuth = azimuth of rate or measurement (ship track direction or azimuth of slip measurement, for example).
If Azimuth = 0, the total scalar slip rate between the blocks is used.
<li>Smin = minimum velocity sigma allowed (if sigma < Smin, sigma is set to Smin)
<li>Label = label (< 30-chars, no blanks, else put in quotes)
<li>Type:
<ul>
<li>if Type = 0, V1 = mean horizontal rate, V2 = rate sigma, treat as Gaussian data
<li>if Type = 1, V1 = mean horizontal rate, V2 = rate sigma, treat as Uniform (min/max) data; min = V1-V2, max=V1+V2; sigma = V2
<li>if Type = 2, V1 = min horizontal rate, V2 = max horizontal rate, treat as Uniform (min/max) data; sigma = (V2-V1)/2
<li>if Type = 3, V1 = min horizontal rate, V2 = max horizontal rate, treat as Gaussian data; mean = (V1+V2)/2; sigma = (V2-V1)/2 (assumes min/max range is +/- 2 sigma)
</ul></ul>

Examples:
<pre>

</pre>
where the file 'saf_rate.dat' contains data lines that look like 
<pre>

</pre>
or an alternate file format:
<pre>
srf: "saf_rate.dat"  1 0 0
</pre>
where the file 'saf_rate.dat' contains data lines that have the block names and look like  
<pre>

or an input line in the control file:
<pre>
srd: NOAM PACI 242.2 33.3 25.4 3.4 320 0.0 0 Parkfield
</pre>
<p>For Gaussian fitting the penalty is the (residual/sigma)**2, where the residual is the difference between the 
calculated value and the mean observed value. For the uniform fitting, the residual is how far the calculated value 
falls outside the min/max range of the observed value and the penalty is the (residual/sigma)**2.

<ul>
<li>Name = unique 4-char code name for this GPS time series file
<li>filename = file containing data
<li>N = index for the GPS velocity field rotation pole (used in GI: option)
<li>F = sigma scaling factor (each sigma multiplied by F so weight is multiplied by 1/F**2; default = 1.0)

<li>dT - time increment (in days) for synthetic time series
<li>Smax - maximum uncertainty allowed (days with larger sigma for any component are removed)
<li>T1 T2 are first and last dates (decimal years) to be read in and used
<li>Eo No Uo = offset flags for components E N U (see below)
<li>Ev Nv Uv = slope flags for components E N U (see below)

The offset flags (Eo No Uo) control what to do with the offsets and seasonal signals for the 3 components 
Flag = 0 don't use this component 
       1 fix at current value 
       2 solve for offset by regression
       3 solve for offset and one periodic signal (yearly period) 
       4 solve for offset and two periodic signals (yearly and 6-month periods) 
        
The slope flags (Ev Nv Uv):
Flag = 0 don't use slope (set slope to 0)
       1 fix at value read from header line of time series file 
       2 solve for slope by regression
       3 use slope (velocity) from block model
       4 use slope (velocity) from block model and estimate velocity bias

<p>
The format for the time series data (campaign or continuous) is:
<p>

A header line for each site. The header format is indicated by the third character 'x' in the TSx: line.
<pre>
  x  Format

  3  Lon  Lat  Elevation(kms) Site       
  4  Site Lon  Lat  Elevation(kms) Ve Se Vn Sn Vz Sz      
</pre>
Rne is the North-East correlation. The velocities and sigmas need not be accurate, if you are solving for them. If you fix them (using 1 for Ev Nv Uv), they should be good velocities.
<p>
Then each epoch (measurement) is in the form:
<pre>
 Yr  Pe Se Pn Sn Pu Su
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Yr is time in decimal years
<li>Pe Pn Pu are east, north, up positions in mm, usually
relative to first measurement, but arbitrary
<li>Se Sn Su are their sigmas in mm
</ul>
Then as a site separator, set Yr > 3000.0; 9999.0 works
